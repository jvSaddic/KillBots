This repo contains all the code and resources to compile and run KillBots, an iOS tactical simulation game, developed by Ted McCormack and Jeremiah Gage in 2009. It builds and runs fine with XCode 9.4.1 and the iPhone 5s simulator, but I don't have any hardware on which to run it. Let me know if you can get it working on some modern hardware! 

:shipit:
