\f0\fs24 \cf0 Thank you for taking the time to try a beta test of iBots. In order to get the app installed, we will need the UDID of your device so that we may create a provisioning file. This can be found by going to iTunes with your device plugged in and then click on "Serial Number". It should change to a 40 character UDID, then press Cmd-C (Mac) or Ctrl-C (Windows) to copy the ID to the clipboard.\
\
Please respond with your UDID before Wednesday, July 15th so we can get all beta testers in one swoop. Shortly after that we will be sending out the program along with additional instructions on how to install it.}
